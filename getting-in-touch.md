##IRC
You can also chat with us via [IRC](http://www.irchelp.org). There is usually someone hanging out there who can help you, but please be patient as we all have jobs and other things to do :) 

To do so, download any [IRC client](http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/clients), start it up and point it to connect to the IRC channel #shogun at irc.freenode.net. 

You can also connect via webchat#shogun directly in your browser. We started this channel in March 2011 and made chat logs available for your convenience. You may be able to find the answer to your question in the chat history.
