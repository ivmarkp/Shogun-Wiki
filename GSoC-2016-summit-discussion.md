Viktor and Heiko had some really good discussions on the GSoC 2016 mentor summit, as a result of spending a week of hacking Shogun before the summit.



##Hacking
 * Updated the website, and automated its deployment
 * Automated the release process
 * Automate nightly binaries for ubuntu
 * Extended integration testing across all interfaces
 * fixed tons of bugs
 * ...

##Next steps
This is a suggestion for a set of releases, roughly ordered in priority, with big blobs (that require a major release) grouped together. There is a parallel stream of smaller fixes below, along with a set of more vague goals for the more distant future.

###5.0
 * This release was prepared at the summit

###5.1
 * Bugfix release for 5.0
 * We already collected a [milestone](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/milestone/10)
 * Mostly about fixing problems we wanted to fix at the summit, but did not find time.
 * All relatively high priority and should be done before moving on, at least partly

#6.0
