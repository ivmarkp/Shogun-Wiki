### Shogun
I came in touch with Shogun since GSoC 2014. 
I worked on the variational inference for Gaussian processes and sparse Gaussian processes.
I also wrote some optimizers used in stochastic variational inference.

### Ask him about:
 * Gaussian Processes
 * Topic models (eg, Dirichlet Process mixture models)
 * Inference for Covaraiance matrix
 * Optimizers in Shogun
