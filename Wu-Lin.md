### Shogun
I came in touch with Shogun since GSoC 2014. 
I worked on the variational inference for Gaussian processes and sparse Gaussian processes.
I also wrote optimizers used in stochastic variational inference.

### Ask Him About:
 * Gaussian Processes and Dirichlet Processes
 * Probabilistic Topic Models (eg, LDA, CTM)
 * Inference for Covaraiance Matrix
 * Gaussian Processes and Stochastic Optimizers in Shogun
