##Example Patches

Many people have asked us how they should start and what we expect when they first approach Shogun. To give you a better idea, here are some examples of patches that have been successfully merged in the run-up to the GSoC 2014 applications. The take away message is - it's not the size of your patch that matters, but how you show initiative and personal judgement to write something nice.
