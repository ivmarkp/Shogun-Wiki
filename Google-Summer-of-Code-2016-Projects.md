# Google Summer of Code 2016
Welcome Students (and mentors)! See [how to get involved](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Getting-involved) and our [GSoC blog posts](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC-follow-up-blog-posts).

# Potential projects
This is a growing list. To add, please create a new wiki page for each project that you describe. Name them as "GSoC_2016_project_XXX" etc. Here is a [template](GSoC_project_template).

# Main focus
This year's GSoC is about improving Shogun, rather than extending it (exceptions allowed). We also want to recruit new *long-term* developers.

 * *Fewer* new algorithms. Rather improve existing ones: easier use, efficiency, better documentation, more applications
 * *Fewer* students. A chance for more intense mentoring, interaction between students, blogging, documenting

# Projects
**Bold** projects are more likely to happen. **ALL** students will be required to:

 * peer-review a fellow student's work in the final phase of GSoC
 * jointly helpo with the 5.0 release in the final phase of GSoC

Furthermore, we plan an experiment this year: an additional side-project that all students work on jointly and in addition to their main project -- building a [Shogun cookbook](GSoC_2016_project_cookbook)

## Improving Shogun
These are roughly ordered in our priority in them. Most of them *do not* focus on Machine Learning but rather on software engineering.

 * [**Easy installation on major platforms**](GSoC_2015_project_installation)
 * [**Unified ML interface, plugin-based architecture**](GSoC_2015_plugin)
 * [**Fundamental ML: The usual suspects**](GSoC_2016_project_fundamental_usual_suspects)
 * [**A Shogun Detox**](GSoC_2015_clean_up_infrastructure)
 * [**SWIG, Matlab & modular interfaces**](GSoC_2015_project_swig)
 * [HMM cleanup and application](GSoC_2015_project_hmms)
 * [Native MS Windows port](GSoC_2015_windows)
 * [Unifying Shogun's linear algebra](GSoC_2015_project_linalg)
 * [Flexible modelselection 2](GSoC_2015_project_modelselection)
 
## Extending Shogun:
The projects we would like to limit in numbers.

### Algorithms
 * [**Gaussian Processes & tensorflow autodiff**](GSoC_2015_project_large_gps)
 * [**Hip Deep learning**](GSoC_2015_project_deep_learning)
 * [**Fundamental ML: LGSSMs**](GSoC_2015_project_fundamental)
 * [**Density Estimation in Infinite Dimensional Exponential Families**](GSoC_2015_project_kernel_infinite_exponential)
 * [Large scale statistical testing](GSoC_2015_project_large_testing)
 * [Solver for the KKT System](GSoC_2015_project_kkt)
 * [Dual coordinate ascent solver for SO-SVM](GSoC_2015_project_dca_sosvm)
 * [LP/QP Framework](GSoC_2015_project_lpqp)
 * [Debiasing & Cluster computing](GSoC_2015_project_debiasing)


### Framework
 * [**MCMC & Stan**](GSoC_2015_project_MCMC_Stan)
 * [Independent jobs Framework](GSoC_2015_cluster_shogun)
 * [Shogun cloud extensions](GSoC_2015_cloud_shogun)


## Other ideas:
 * Cool pipelines
   * A kaggle pipeline for supervised prediction.
   * Spectrometer (there is an open-source hardward project on this)
   * Music brainz predictions (The cool hair guy at GSoC is the one we should talk to here)
   * Some bio thing?
   * Collaboration with MLPack for toolkit wide performance/accuracy testing

## Infrastructure:
 * [REST interface](GSoC_2015_project_rest)
