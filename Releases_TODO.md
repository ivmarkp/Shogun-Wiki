### Release text draft:
> Dear all,

> we are pleased to announce the 4.1 release of the Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox.

> This release features the work of the new Shogun-team member Wu Lin, who put a lot of work into Shogun's framework for large-scale variational inference for Gaussian Processes. A (very large) notebook explaining a lot of the methods can be found at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/variational_classifier.html

> The release also features a computer-science feature by Esben SÃ¶rig, who designed a meta-language to write Shogun examples in, which are then automatically translated to all of Shogun's interface languages. Documentation can be found at https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Example_Generation

> We also worked towards a smoother build process and did a number of internal efficiency improvements and clean-ups.

> A full list and the download can be found at
> RELEASE TAG HERE, i.e.

> On other news:
>  * We plan to start using Stack Overflow to reply to Shogun questions, rather than the mailing list. This will create a more documented set of Q&A. Github issues are used as before to report/solve problems. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/shogun

>  * The Shogun foundation was recognised as a non-profit organisation by German tax law. This is an important step towards more sustainabl finances of the project.

> Heiko Strathmann, on behalf of the Shogun team
