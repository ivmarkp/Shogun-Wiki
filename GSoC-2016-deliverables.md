# GSoC 2016 Deliverables

(note: this page is not yet final and ongoing work)


It's easy to meet expectations when you know exactly what they are. As a GSoC student, of course we expect you to work on your main project. However, we also require that you contribute to Shoguns documentation, maintenance and outreach. This page gives you an template checklist for your project that you can fill in during the summer. 

## Introduce your project
 * your application already needs a project abstract
 * once accepted, you refine this together with your mentors and keep it up-to-date during the project

## Introduce yourself
We value our students and we want to make sure you get the credit and recognition you deserve for your work. So please introduce yourself briefly to the wider Shogun community.

## Cookbook
The [cookbook](GSoC_2016_project_cookbook) is a platform where Shogun can show-off its strengths. You will help us ensure its impact by 
 * contributing 3 cookbook examples each week
 * writing your own cookbook example 

## Notebook
The cookbook is for communicating the basics of a method. It's too short to showcase all the cool things that people can do with the improvements you made for Shogun. For this, you will write an IPython notebook. Here are some [examples from previous years](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/notebook).  

## Peer-review
In the final phase of GSoC, students review each other's projects. 

## Blog-post
Do good and tell the world about it ... we expect you to write a short blog post about your GSoC experience with Shogun. This is what [people wrote so far](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC-follow-up-blog-posts).
